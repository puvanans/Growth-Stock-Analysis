Forbes VS Market

Early last year, Forbes listed ten growth stocks to invest in. Wanting to find the performance of these stocks, I analyzed the price data of the recommended companies and the American market for the year 2022.
Here is the article, updated for 2023 but containing the same companies.

[10 Best Growth Stocks Of 2023 – Forbes Advisor - Investing](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-growth-stocks/)

Conclusion
Much money was lost last year. 
But our goal was to test Forbes’ recommendation. If they were right, the bottom graph would show better growth than the top. That is not the case. 6 out of 10 recommended stocks failed to match the market, let alone outperform it.
